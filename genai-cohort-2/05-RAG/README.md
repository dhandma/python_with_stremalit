ðŸ“„ PDF Chatbot Assistant
This project allows you to upload a PDF file and chat with it using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model. The PDF content is embedded into a Qdrant vector database and queried intelligently to answer your questions.

ðŸ”§ Features
Upload PDF files via the UI (max 200MB)

Content is chunked and indexed using LangChain + Qdrant

Ask questions related to the uploaded PDF

Answers are based on vector similarity context from the document

Clean, dark-themed chat interface

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install Dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
